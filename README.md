Problem 1(About 50 Startups): has solved by Linear Regression, because first we have to predict profit value and then by comparative analysis we can predict which country is going to gain more profit in the future. There are infinite possible values of profit.

Problem 2(About Annual temperature of two industries): As there are infinite possible values of temperature for the required year, this is regression problem. Thats why Polynomial Regression has been implemented.

Problem 3(About Global CO2 Production): As the scattered plot of data clearly shows 4 degree curve fit perfectly minimizing the loss. Thus Polynomial Regression has been implemented.

Problem 4(About predicting the house price using ID): When ID is inserted the house price would be predicted. The scattered plot is not much clear. As it is not a classification problem, DecisionTree is not suitable for its solution.

Problem 5(About predicting Income by Monthly experience): This is regression problem and Scattered plot simply shows that the Polynomial Regression fit best minimizing the loss.
